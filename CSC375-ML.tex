General Catalog Description: This course explores advanced computer science topics not available in other courses, as well as new topics as they emerge in this rapidly evolving discipline. Topics may be interdisciplinary.

Specific Course Description: Students are initially introduced to the fundamentals of Python programming. Machine Learning concepts
are covered by using Jupyter Notebook and Python with emphasis given to the use of PyTorch library with applications.
Students are expected to work in groups to explain theoretical Machine Learning concepts with real-life applications and
strategize and solve problems. Participants are also introduced to basic bioinformatics concepts by using Biopython. Healthcare
applications are emphasized throughout the course. The completion of a real-life semester project in groups is an essential
component of grading and participation.
