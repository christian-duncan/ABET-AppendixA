This course provides an introduction to the classical theory of computer science.
In particular, it covers automata, formal languages, computability, and complexity.

Our aim in this course is to develop a fundamental understanding of the nature of computing.
Throughout all the topics, we will answer one underlying question stated on page 1 of the course textbook:
\begin{quote}
``What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?''
\end{quote}
We will look at sub-questions like: ``What can be computed?''; ``How do you prove something
cannot be computed?  (Is this even possible?)''; ``What makes some problems so much harder
than others to solve?''
  }

    Course Learning Outcomes (the student will be able to):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create finite state and push-down automata with specific properties (to recognize specific languages).
\item Create regular and context-free grammars with specific properties (to generate specific languages).
\item Use the pumping lemma to show particular problems cannot be solved by finite state automata (particular languages are not regular).
\item Use the pumping lemma to show particular problems cannot be solved by push-down automata (particular languages are not context-free).
\item Create Turing Machines to solve particular problems (to recognize specific languages).
\item Use diagonalization or reducibility methods to prove a problem is undecidable.
\item Explain the importance of NP-completeness and the ``P=NP'' problem.
\item Use reducibility to prove a problem is NP-complete.
\item Explain the relationship between deterministic and non-deterministic computation time and space.
\end{enumerate}
