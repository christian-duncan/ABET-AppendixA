Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella topic covering efforts in a variety of fields all searching for one goal: to get computers to perform well at tasks at which humans excel. Topics include fundamental issues in intelligent systems, search and optimization methods, knowledge representation and reasoning, learning, agents, computer vision, natural language processing, pattern recognition, advanced machine learning, robotics, knowledge-based systems, neural networks and genetic algorithms.
