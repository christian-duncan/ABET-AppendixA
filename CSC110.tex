This course is an introduction to computer programming. While we will be studying the Scala
programming language, we will be focusing on good programming practice and introductory prob-
lem solving techniques that will provide you with the tools to write efficient, correct code in any
programming language. This course is not just a programming course! Note that this course is
a synchronus WEB course run as a flipped classroom. Students prepare for each class/module
by completing outside work (videos, readings, quizzes, etc) and spend class time synchronously
working either individually or in groups on small projects. When learning to program, there is no
substitute to writing code, and we will spend as much time as possible doing that this semester.

    Learning Objectives (the student will be able to):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Discuss the challenges inherent in communicating with (programming) a (non-reasoning)
computer
      \item Break a complex problem down into smaller more manageable components
      \item Provide step-by-step instructions to solve small computational problems
      \item Using at least one programming language, write examples of and solve problems in pro-
grams with the following basic programming constructs and tools
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Mathematical expressions
            \item Conditional expressions
            \item Simple iterative statements
            \item Simple functions
            \item Simple data structures, such as arrays, lists, and strings
          \end{itemize}
      \item Discuss the importance of commenting and good code structure and style
    \end{itemize}
  }

\item explicitly indicate which of the student outcomes listed in Criterion 3 or any other outcomes are addressed by the course.\\
