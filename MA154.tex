    Course Learning Objectives (the student will be able to):
    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Analyze equations and properties of parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas.
    \item To understand the polar coordinate system.  
    \item Rewrite rectangle coordinates into parametric and polar coordinates and vice versa.
    \item To find different ways to describe curves in two and three dimensions: parametric equations, polar coordinates.
    \item To use parametric and polar coordinates to compute area and arc length.
    \item To solve first order differential equations in one variable by observation, separation of variables, and other techniques.
    \item To use differential equations to model real-life problems and solve them: growth, decay, etc.
    \item To understand vectors in two and three dimensions.
    \item To use various operations to analyze vectors: dot product, scalar product, cross product, norms, projections, etc.
