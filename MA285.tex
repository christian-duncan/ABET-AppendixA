This introductory statistics course is intended primarily for students majoring in engineering, mathematics or the sciences. Emphasis is on using statistics to answer questions in the physical and social sciences. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression, analysis of variance, chi-square tests and nonparametric methods. Students are required to analyze real data sets using Excel, SAS, SPSS or similar computer programs. Students are not allowed to receive credit for more than one of the following courses: MA 206, MA 275 and MA 285.

    Course Learning Objectives (the student will be able to):
    \begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Students will describe real-world data using descriptive statistics and
visualizations and will identify patterns in the data using these tools.
\item Students will associate real-world systems with probability distributions
and use these distributions to answer scientific questions.
\item Students will use tools from probability theory and statistics to describe
systems whose attributes vary, estimate common values for these
attributes, and provide uncertainty quantification for these estimates.
\item Students will use statistical inference to assess the veracity of hypotheses
in the natural, social, and applied sciences.
\item Students will use the relationship between two or more random variables
to infer functional relationships in empirical systems and predict unknown
states of these systems.
\item Students will evaluate the effectiveness of a statistical analysis to discern
whether the analysisâ€™s conclusions are valid.
\item Students will implement common statistical techniques using R.
    \end{enumerate}
