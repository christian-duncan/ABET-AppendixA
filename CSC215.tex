    This course presents a study of the design and analysis of algorithms. Topics include asymptotic analysis, complexity theory, sorting and searching, underlying data structures, recursion, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and NP-completeness. Additional topics may include graph algorithms, probabilistic algorithms, distributed computing and parallel algorithms.

    Course Learning Objectives (the student will be able to):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use mathematical and computational concepts, such as inductive reasoning and recurrence relations, to analyze an algorithm's asymptotic run-time performance;
\item Use creative thinking skills in solving computational problems;
\item Apply brute-force, exhaustive search, dynamic programming, and greedy techniques in developing algorithmic solutions;
\item Apply decrease-and-conquer (prune-and-search) and divide-and-conquer techniques in developing
algorithmic solutions;
\item Describe and apply various advanced data structures such as balanced binary trees, heaps,
hashtables, and graphs in the design and analysis of efficient algorithms;
\item Explain the basic premise behind the class of NP-complete problems; and
\item Use experimental analysis to test the practical validity of a data structure or algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
  }

\item explicitly indicate which of the student outcomes listed in Criterion 3 or any other outcomes are addressed by the course.\\
